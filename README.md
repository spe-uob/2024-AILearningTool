## Project Brief
"Create a web app Watson chatbot that the students (users) can access via a QR code from their
mobile device. The QR code could be printed out and left at strategic areas around the university for
new students to see.
The chatbot would provide information that a university student wished they knew when they first
arrived at your university. The content of the chatbot could be targeted to serve the students of a
particular course - or it could be usable by every university student at your university.
Content can include:
- what is IBM SkillsBuild
- what courses are available on SkillsBuild
- what free technologies are available on SkillsBuild
- allow the student to enter details of their course details - and provide links to relevant
SkillsBuild resources."

## Stakeholders
### Students:
- Receive personalized course recommendations
- Ask questions about navigating the platform and courses
- Access resources and assistance to resolve issues quickly
- View recommended learning paths and certifications

### IBM SkillsBuild Team:
- Monitor user interactions with the chatbot
- Analyze which chatbot responses are most helpful or effective based on user ratings.
- Manage chatbot content, updates, and integrations with the platform
- Escalate complex queries from the chatbot to human support

### Data Protection Authorities:
- Ensure compliance with data protection laws (e.g., GDPR)
- Monitor how user data is collected, processed, and stored
- Verify that the chatbot handles sensitive user information securely
- Enforce privacy guidelines for user consent and data management

## User stories

## Tech Stack:
### Frontend
The front end is a JavaScript Vue 3-based web application. It makes requests to the backend using HTTP requests.
### Backend
The backend is based on Spring Boot (an open-source Java framework).
Data will be stored in a SQLite database.
User prompts for the chatbot will be sent using API requests from the Spring Boot backend to the OpenAI language model.

## User Instructions:

1. **Open the Web App**:  

   Using any device with internet access (smartphone, tablet, laptop, etc.), open a web browser and navigate to [https://ailearningtool.ddns.net](https://ailearningtool.ddns.net).

2. **Cookie Consent**:  

   Upon opening the website, you will see a prompt notifying you that the chatbot uses local storage. By clicking "I Understand", you consent to the use of local storage for saving your preferences and conversation history. This helps the chatbot provide a more personalized experience across sessions.

3. **Login Page**: 

   To access the chatbot, you must first register an account. Once registered, you can log in using your credentials.

4. **Start Chatting with the Chatbot**:  

   After logging in, you can choose from three chat initialization buttons:
   - **I need help with choosing a course**
   - **I need help with the IBM SkillsBuild platform**
   - **I have questions about university life**

5. **Providing Additional Information**:  

   For certain queries (like "I need help with choosing a course"), the chatbot may ask for a little more information. This could include:
   - Your current experience level
   - Your preferred duration for the course
   - Specific topics or skills you're interested in
     
   The chatbot only asks whatâ€™s necessary to give you the best answer.

6. **Follow-Up Questions**:  

   Feel free to ask any follow-up questions after the chatbot provides its initial response. The chatbot can also share useful resources, such as links to courses.

7. **Returning to the Chat**:  

   If you click "I Understand", your conversation history and preferences will be saved in local storage. You can return to the web app at any time to continue where you left off or ask follow-up questions based on previous conversations.

8. **Add to Home Screen or Desktop**:

   If you enjoy using our app, feel free to download it to your home screen or desktop. Since weâ€™ve implemented Progressive Web App (PWA) support, you can install the app on your device for quick access without needing to visit the website each time.

## Chatbot Interaction Flow:

This flowchart outlines the interaction pathways within the chatbot, guiding users through key topics such as SkillsBuild courses, university life questions, and IBM SkillsBuild platform information. Each pathway details the chatbot's prompts, and user responses, providing an overview of the chatbotâ€™s functionality.

## Developer Instructions:
To get started with developing or contributing to this project, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   First, ensure you have [Git installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) on your machine. Then, open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to clone the repository:
   ```git clone https://github.com/spe-uob/2024-AILearningTool.git```.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   After cloning, navigate to the project directory:
   ```cd 2024-AILearningTool```.

3. **Backend Requirements**:
   The backend of this project is built using Java 21 and uses Maven as the build automation tool. Shell scripts are also required to build the backend, so make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
   - Latest Java Development Kit (JDK) 21 installation guide [here](https://www.oracle.com/uk/java/technologies/downloads/#java21).
   - Latest Maven stable release installation guide [here](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
   - Linux-based operating system with Bash support (to execute `localExecute.sh` shell script).

4. **Frontend Requirements**:
   The frontend of this project is built using Vue 3, and it also requires npm and Yarn. Also, the frontend unit tests use Jest. Make sure you have them installed: 
   - npm installation guide [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).
   - Yarn installation guide [here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable).
   - Vue 3 installation guide [here](https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start.html).
   - Jest installation guide [here](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started).

5. **Continuous Deployment with Docker**:
     This project uses Docker for Continuous Deployment (CD), so you will need to ensure that Docker is installed on the server (and your local machine if you wish). If it 
     isn't installed, you can do so [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
     CD is implemented using `deploy-ghcr.yml` GitHub workflow.
     The workflow initialises the latest version of Ubuntu OS, sets up Java 21 and Maven;
     substitutes the `$OPENAI_API_KEY` in `OpenAIAuthenticator.java` file to the OpenAI API key;
     replaces `application.properties` file with a one that enables HTTPS and uses `keystore.p12`;
     replaces `$BACKEND_URL` variable in frontend;
     builds the `.jar` file and a container with it, pushes the container to GHCR;
     connects to your server using `ssh`, pull the container from GHCR and runs it.

     It uses the following "secrets":
     - `OPENAI_API_KEY` - stores OpenAI API key, can be obtained [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
     - `CONTAINER_REGISTRY_PAT` - PAT for GHCR.
     - `SERVER_IP` - IP address of your server.
     - `SERVER_USER` - Username that the workflow can ssh to your server with.
     - `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` - Private key that can be used to authenticate to your server.
     It also uses `BACKEND_URL` environment variable, which is defined on line 13.

     Please ensure that you have a `database.db` file in the SSH user directory on the server. If the file does not exist, create one using: ```touch database.db```.

6. **(For CD execution) Add keystore.p12 file to the root of your server**:
   You can obtain private key and full certificate chain files for free using [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) - a software that helps with issuing Let's Encrypt certificates.
   You then have to create `keystore.p12` that has to contain both private key and full certificate chain files, protected by password noted in `application.properties` (default:`ailearntool`).
   If you don't want to use SSL - don't use the Docker image, but run the server using `localExecute.sh` instead.

7. **Open the Project in Your IDE**:
   Open the cloned repository in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) (we recommend [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=windows)) for further development.

8. **Test and Run the Application**:
   - To run the backend unit tests, use the commands: ```cd backend``` and then ```mvn test```.
   - To run the frontend unit tests, use the commands: ```cd frontend``` and then ```npm run test:unit```.
   - To run the application, run the localExecute shell script: ```./localExecute.sh OpenAI_API_Key Port_number``` (replace OpenAI_API_Key and Port_number with their respective values).
