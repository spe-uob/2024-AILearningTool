## Project brief
"Create a web app Watson chatbot that the students (users) can access via a QR code from their
mobile device. The QR code could be printed out and left at strategic areas around the university for
new students to see.
The chat bot would provide Information that a university student wished they knew when they first
arrived at your university. The content of the chatbot could be targeted to serve the students of a
particular course - or It could be usable by every university student at your university.
Content can Include
- what is IBM SkillsBuild
- what courses are available on SkillsBuild
- what free technologies are available on SkillsBuild
- allow the student to enter details of their course details - and provide links to relevant
SkillsBuild resources."
