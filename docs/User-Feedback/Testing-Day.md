# Suggestions

1\. Apostrophes appear as question marks in the chatbot response  
~~2\. I asked some questions about life in university like pay fees, check attendance,all these question could be found in university of bristol website,I suggest that you can let your ai get these answers from that website and also giving a directed website about the answers,to conclusion,I'm highly looking to further increase about it(‚ó¶Àô‚ñΩÀô‚ó¶)~~  
3\. UI can be improved

1) 

4\. Add login system  
5\. ~~Adding a dark mode would be nice~~  
6\. Use Vercel to make your frontend. Avoid wasting time on small details. Aim to get core functionality working (eg the chatbot not responding correctly)  
7\. I don't like AI tools. The UI can be made more aesthetically pleasing and readable  
8\. Better UI  
9\. Update the UI \- make it slightly more modern, get rid of the ? Instead of '  
10\. Maybe make it more user friendly and maybe more languages too  
11\. maybe make the history tab a bit lighter because it was distracting  
12\. 1\) Support Unicode ~~2\) Prefill the first theme QA to reduce first time response time 3\) optional cookies should not affect browser stored conversation history because it's an essential feature~~  
13\. make high contrast mode just black and white. add suggestion /prompt buttons for conversation starters
