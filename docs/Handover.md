# AILearningTool - Project Handover Document

---

## 1. Overview

**Project Name:** AILearningTool  

**Description:**  
AILearningTool is a web-based chatbot developed using **Spring Boot** (backend) and **Vue.js** (frontend). The chatbot would provide information that a university student wished they knew when they first arrived at your university. The content of the chatbot could be targeted to serve the students of a particular course - or it could be usable by every university student at your university. Content can include:

- what is IBM SkillsBuild
- what courses are available on SkillsBuild
- what free technologies are available on SkillsBuild
- allow the student to enter details of their course details - and provide links to relevant SkillsBuild resources.

![Architecture Diagram](https://github.com/spe-uob/2024-AILearningTool/blob/feature/issue-210/Improve-documentation/docs/Diagrams/architecture_diagram.png)
### Backend

- **Framework:** Spring Boot 3.3.4  
- **Main Functionality:**  
  - User and chat management (signup, chat creation, sending messages, retrieving chat history).
  - Integration with external AI/TTS APIs.
- **Key Files:**  
  - `AiLearningToolApplication.java`: Main application file; handles configuration overwrites and SSL keystore setup.
  - `DatabaseController.java`: Manages user and chat data.
  - `SpringController.java`: Exposes REST endpoints for chat interactions.
- **Dependencies:**  
  - Spring Boot Starter Web, Security, JDBC, Logging.

### Frontend

- **Framework:** Vue.js  
- **Key Features:**  
  - Chat UI with a welcome screen, message display (including markdown formatting and animation via the TypingText component), and an input area.
  - Text-to-speech (TTS) functionality using the Web Speech API, with a speaker icon provided for assistant messages.
  - Automated frontend build integrated with the backend using Maven (frontend-maven-plugin).
- **Key Files & Directories:**  
  - `src/components/MainContent.vue`: Main chat component.
  - `src/components/helpers/TypingText.vue`: Component to animate assistant messages.
  - `src/assets/`: Contains theme configuration and language translation files.
- **Build Process:**  
  - Managed by the frontend-maven-plugin in the Maven build.
  - The frontend build output (from `npm run build`) is copied into `backend/src/main/resources/static`.

cd 2024-AILearningTool
```

### Build and Deploy Project

**Navigate to backend directory**
```bash
cd backend
```

**Clean and build entire project (includes frontend build)**
```bash
mvn clean package
```
**Run Spring Boot application**
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```
**Access the Application:**

- Local:
```bash

## 4. Configuration Details
### Application Properties ###
- Location:
  - backend/src/main/resources/application.properties
- Key Settings:
  - server.port: Default is 8080.
  - SSL settings (keystore, key alias, etc.) if HTTPS is enabled.
  - Encoding settings:
    ``` bash
    Copy
    spring.http.encoding.charset=UTF-8
    spring.http.encoding.enabled=true
    spring.http.encoding.force=true
    ```

- Overwriting at Runtime:
  - The AiLearningToolApplication.java file includes a method to overwrite application.properties at startup, ensuring the latest configuration (including encoding and SSL settings) is used.

### Frontend Configuration ###
- Dependencies:
  - Managed via package.json.
- Build Automation:
  - The Maven plugin frontend-maven-plugin runs npm install and npm run build from the frontend folder. The output is copied to backend/src/main/resources/static.

## 5. Testing & Troubleshooting
- Running backend tests:
  ```bash
  mvn test
  ```
- Running frontend tests:
  ```bash
  npm run test:unit
  ```
- Debugging:
  - Use browser developer tools to inspect console errors, network requests, and verify resource loading.
  - For backend debugging, enable Spring Boot DevTools for live reload.
