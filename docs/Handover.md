## Code Explanation:

### Backend:

- **Framework:** Spring Boot 3.3.4  
- **Main Functionality:**  
  - User and chat management (signup, chat creation, sending messages, retrieving chat history).
  - Integration with external AI APIs.
- **Key Files:**  
  - `AiLearningToolApplication.java`: Main application file; handles configuration overwrites and SSL keystore setup.
  - `DatabaseController.java`: Manages user and chat data.
  - `SpringController.java`: Exposes REST endpoints for chat interactions.
  - `main/resources`: Includes static resources such as application properties.
  - `main/test` Incldes all backend unit tests (in Java).
- **Dependencies:**  
  - Spring Boot Starter Web, Security, JDBC, Logging.

### Frontend:

- **Framework:** Vue.js  
- **Key Features:**  
  - Chat UI with a welcome screen, message display (including markdown formatting and animation via the TypingText component), and an input area.
  - Text-to-speech (TTS) functionality using the Web Speech API, with a speaker icon provided for assistant messages.
  - Automated frontend build integrated with the backend using Maven (frontend-maven-plugin).
- **Key Files & Directories:**
  - `src/Display interface`: Includes Vue components for login, main view, and cookie management.
  - `src/components/MainContent.vue`: Main chat component.
  - `src/components/helpers/TypingText.vue`: Component to animate assistant messages.
  - `src/assets/`: Contains theme configuration and language translation files.
  - `src/main`: Initializes the Vue app, imports dependencies, and mounts the root component.
  - `tests/unit`: Includes all frontend unit tests (in Jest).
- **Build Process:**  
  - Managed by the frontend-maven-plugin in the Maven build.
  - The frontend build output (from `npm run build`) is copied into `backend/src/main/resources/static`.

## Setup & Installation:

### Prerequisites:
- Java JDK 21+  
- Maven 3.6+  
- Node.js (recommended v18+) & npm (managed by frontend-maven-plugin)  
- Git

### Cloning the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/spe-uob/2024-AILearningTool.git
```

### Building the Project:

**Navigate to project directory**
```bash
cd 2024-AILearningtool.git
```

**Clean and build entire project**
```bash
./localExecute.sh <OpenAI API Key>
```

**Access the Application:**

- Local:
```bash
http://localhost:8080
```
- On AWS/EC2:
```bash
Use the instanceâ€™s public IP or DNS with port 8080 (e.g., http://<public-ip>:8080).
```
---
## Configuration Details:
### Application Properties ###
- Location:
  - backend/src/main/resources/application.properties
- Key Settings:
  - server.port: Default is 8080.
  - SSL settings (keystore, key alias, etc.) if HTTPS is enabled.
  - Encoding settings:
    ``` bash
    Copy
    spring.http.encoding.charset=UTF-8
    spring.http.encoding.enabled=true
    spring.http.encoding.force=true
    ```

- Overwriting at Runtime:
  - The AiLearningToolApplication.java file includes a method to overwrite application.properties at startup, ensuring the latest configuration (including encoding and SSL settings) is used.

### Frontend Configuration ###
- Dependencies:
  - Managed via package.json.
- Build Automation:
  - The Maven plugin frontend-maven-plugin runs npm install and npm run build from the frontend folder. The output is copied to backend/src/main/resources/static.
---
## Testing & Troubleshooting:
- Running backend tests:
  ```bash
  mvn test
  ```
- Running frontend tests:
  ```bash
  npm run test:unit
  ```
- Debugging:
  - Use browser developer tools to inspect console errors, network requests, and verify resource loading.
  - For backend debugging, enable Spring Boot DevTools for live reload.
